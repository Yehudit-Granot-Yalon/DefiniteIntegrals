Program Description:

Create a program that performs distributed integral calculation using multiple threads.
Prompt the user to enter an integral expression and analyze its content for calculation.
Thread Generation:

Generate a specific number of threads based on the first argument provided when running the program.
Handle cases where the number of threads cannot be assumed.
Integral Calculation:

Design a function to numerically calculate the integral for a given range.
Distribute the integral calculation workload among the threads.
Thread Execution:

Execute the threads to perform the integral calculation for their assigned range.
Ensure proper synchronization between threads.
Result Aggregation:

Collect and aggregate the results obtained from each thread.
Perform any necessary calculations or manipulations on the collected results.
Error Handling and Edge Cases:

Implement error handling for invalid user input or edge cases.
Validate input integrity and handle exceptions.
Output and Reporting:

Provide output to display the calculated integral value or relevant statistics.
Format the output in a readable manner.
